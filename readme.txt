Hello!

This is the project directory for my (Peter Shi) SUDS 2023 project supervised by Prof. Jo Bovy on adapting the astroNN package to SDSS-V data

This project is broadly divided into 5 stages:
    1. Exploration of the astroNN package and working with spectral data and .fits files 
        Exploration and Initial Analysis
    2. Comparison of SDSS-IV and SDSS-V spectra using a crossmatch file of what should be the same set of stars 
        IV-V Comparisons
    3. Analysis and application of a pretrained model to SDSS-V data 
        SDSS-V Analysis
    4. Retraining a new model and applying it to both the SDSS-IV and SDSS-V data 
        Retraining 
    5. Investigation Into Attention
        Attention

Error Records just contain a few .txt files of some errors I ran into. Shouldn't be too relevant for the purposes of reproduction of results

It should be noted that these divisions are not perfect and that there may be some overlap, especially in earlier files/notebooks which are more poorly organized 

Each folder will also have its own readme file which go into more depth explaining each notebook

Project poster and summary document are present
