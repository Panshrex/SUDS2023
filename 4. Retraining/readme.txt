This folder contains notebooks relevant to retraining an astroNN model and applying the same analysis techniques to both the crossmatch spectra and the full set of SDSS-V spectra 

Many notebooks here are just copied and edited to adapt them to the new model with minimal changes 

retrain compile compiles the new training data from the SDSS-V allStar file 

retrain retrains a new model on the new dataset 

prediction analysis retrain runs inference and analysis on the crossmatch stars 

h5 analysis retrain runs inference and analysis on the full SDSS-V spectra set
