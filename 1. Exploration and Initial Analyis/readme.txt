This folder only contains one file which just serves to explore the structure of .fits files and pickle serialization of spectral data 

This should not be too relevant to people already familiar with working with SDSS data files 

It should also be noted that this is not exhaustive. It was only created after I obtained access to the UofT astro SSH server

A significant amount of initial exploration was also done in my private google drive

The notebooks there will not be copied over since they are not relevant to the results of my later analysis
